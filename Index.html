    <h2>Types of Rocks</h2>

    <p>There are three main types of rocks: igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><b>Igneous Rocks</b>: These fiery rocks are formed when molten rock (magma) cools and crystallizes. Magma can cool either above or below the Earth's surface, resulting 

in different types of igneous rocks. Granite, basalt, and obsidian are all examples of igneous rocks.
        
      </li>
      <li><b>Sedimentary Rocks</b>: These layered rocks are formed from the accumulation of sediments like sand, gravel, and organic matter. Over time, these sediments are compressed and cemented together, forming sedimentary rocks. Sandstone, limestone, and shale are some common examples.
        
      </li>
      <li><b>Metamorphic Rocks</b>: These transformed rocks are formed when existing rocks are subjected to intense heat, pressure, or both. The original rock undergoes a physical and chemical change, resulting in a new metamorphic rock. Marble, slate, and quartzite are all examples of metamorphic rocks.
